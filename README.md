# Industrial Automation
A 3 piston automation using 5 arduinos and 3 protocols: xbee, i2c and ethernet.

The goal for this project was making a sequence using the above system. However, my personal goal was to make a dynamic code that could handle any sequence.

The project is detailed in the pdf in the root (in portuguese).
